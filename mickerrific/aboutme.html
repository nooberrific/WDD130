<div class ="about-parag">
    <p>When I'm not making funny internet videos, I'm most likely busy studying software engineering. Right now I work for a company as a customer support specialist, but my dream is that I will end up working for a big company like Walmart or Amazon as a web developer or programmer one day. Coding, typing, and solving problems are what I enjoy doing most. As a matter of fact, I made this website myself for a web design class.</p>

<div class ="about-parag">As well as computers, I am also passionate about music. I love listening to it and playing it. I have been playing piano for a couple years now and love to compose my own music and arrangements. I also love playing video games, especially the ones made by Nintendo. Laughter is a must in my life, and one of my biggest goals is to help others to enjoy it as much as I do. My brother is also really funny, making videos with him is my favorite thing to do. We have been laughing and playing together for our whole lives.</div>
