    <p>So, you're finally here. You found my website. Congratulations, you're in for a treat! My name is Mickerrific, as you could have probably guessed from the massive banner at the top of the page. I am an aspiring youtuber. I love making funny skits and playing video games. The reason why I've made this website is so that you can have some fun. This website has some exclusive content that can't be found anywhere else on the internet. If by some chance you want to know me a little better as well, there is an about me page which gives some more insight into who I actually am. There are also dreafts of my scripts and short stories which have never been seen by the public eye yet. There are links to my personal favorite videos made by myself, but also my favorite videos made by other people on Youtube. My main goal is that you will enjoy yourself as a direct result from coming here. Please enjoy!</p>
