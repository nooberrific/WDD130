      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been mindlessly scrolling on your device, completely bored out of your mind? Well, my hope is that my website will help to solve this! Under the alias “Mickerrific,” my goal is to help rid the world of boredom and sorrow. The biggest difference between most content and mine is that I will always provide clean humor which is targeted towards all audiences. This website will help others to get to know me a little better and find some entertainment that is easily accessible on-site as well. With convenient links to my YouTube videos, as well as scripts and personal stories which aren't accessible anywhere else, the fun will be limitless. No more boredom, just quick and easy access to eventual hours of fun. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I would say that my target audience is mostly the high schoolers, middle schoolers, and young adults in the world who like to play video games, but my goal is for my website to eventually (probably gonna have to keep working on it after this classw) have a wide variety of content within it so that it can reach out to people of all ages. I especially want people who are very bored to come to my website. I want my website to be a fun place to be.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        [So, you're finally here. You found my website. Congratulations, you're in for a treat! My name is Mickerrific, as you could have probably guessed from the massive banner at the top of the page. I am an aspiring youtuber. I love making funny skits and playing video games. The reason why I've made this website is so that you can have some fun. This website has some exclusive content that cant' be found anywhere else on the internet. If by some chance you want to know me a little better as well, there is an about me page which gives some more insight into who I actually am. There are also dreafts of my scripts and short stories which have never been seen by the public eye yet. There are links to my personal favorite videos made by myself, but also my favorite videos made by other people on Youtube. My main goal is that you will enjoy yourself as a direct result from coming here. Please enjoy! ]

      <h3>[About Me]</h3>
      <p>
        [When I'm not making funny internet videos, I'm probably busy studying software engineering. I'm hoping to work for a company as a web developer one day. Coding and solving problems are what I enjoy doing. I made this website myself for a class actually. As well as computers, I am also passionate about music. I love listening to it and playing it. I have been playing piano for a couple years now and love to compose my own music and arrangements. I also love playing video games, especially the ones made by Nintendo. Laughter is a must in my life, and one of my biggest goals is to help others to enjoy it as much as I do. My brother is also really funny, making videos with him is my favorite thing to do. We have been laughing and playing together for our whole lives.]

        How it Feels to Chew 5 Gum
        I held the brittle stick in my hand, its heft surprising to the mind. An antiquity to be sure, but were the rumors true? Deducing there was but one way to find out (I was always a clever lad mind you), I took a bite and began to chew, its minty nectar gently caressing each individual ridge of my taste buds. My mind went blank. When I came to, I cried out, 'Huzzah! What lofty giddiness is inspired within my mind, evidenced in the increasing rate of palpation within my breast! Never before have I experienced such vigor coursing through my veins and even in my very being. My senses have been stimulated, nary to return to previous levels of sorrow. Truly, my friends, this is indeed, 'how it feels to chew 5 gum.'
